There a 3 options for running the software\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Entering the following command\+: ./\+Tram\+\_\+\+Netwerk This will use a hardcoded X\+ML File, defined in the main.\+cpp file.
\item Entering the following command\+: ./\+Tram\+\_\+\+Netwerk 1 $<$\+X\+M\+L$>$, in which $<$\+X\+M\+L$>$ is the relative path from the rootfolder to the X\+ML File
\item Entering the following command\+: ./\+Tram\+\_\+\+Netwerk 2 This will also use a hardcoded X\+ML File, defined in the main.\+cpp file, so two different files can be hardcoded for easy use.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To run the debug version of the executable, enter the following command\+: ./\+Tram\+\_\+\+Netwerk\+\_\+debug
